    <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">First time I ever heard tongues I was spending the night over at Johnny Bonifay's house. We were in second grade together, so that would have made me all of seven, maybe eight years old. The Bonifays, they were a poor southern family. There were lots of them scattered around town, most of them shade-tree mechanics and day laborers and what have you. This was the first time Id slept over somewhere and I was thrilled when Johnny'd asked me. I'd been to his house after school a few times before and it was just brimming with a sort of run-down, worrisome energy that I liked, although I couldn't quite say why.</p>
    <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Saturday afternoon me and Johnny, we rode our stingray bikes down to the railroad trestle and threw rocks at a few passing freight trains. We looked for arrowheads in a field and saw deer tracks but no deer. Later as the streetlights flickered on closer to town we hightailed it back to Johnny's house, ate dinner on the front porch as it was hot that day. Then his aunt and cousins stopped by. Them and Johnny's two older brothers started swapping stories about various relatives of theirs with strange names like Pulpwood, Uncle A.R. and Headache. They laughed and laughed at the carrying-ons of their crazy relations. When that line of thought ran its course they told old stale jokes that even little kids knew. I laughed just to be polite. Through it all they shelled peanuts one by one, as if it was the most compelling activity on the face of the earth.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Johnny's older sister Jeanette, she liked to sing along with the radio, and about had a convulsion every time a Conway Twitty song'd come on. Johnny's brothers tended to roll their eyes when she'd start yowling and hopping around, trying to get one of them to dance with her. The mother seemed consumed in thought all the time—her face was like a storefront that had been boarded up. The father, he was off working a night-shift at the paper mill north of town.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Johnny and I slept on the lumpy old foldout couch. First thing Sunday morning we were rousted out of bed, roughly groomed and fed, then hustled into the Bonifay's Rambler American. Johnny's wordless daddy drove as his mama hummed hymn sounding songs to herself, him smoking unfiltered Chesterfields with all the windows rolled up. All total there was seven of us in the car. This was all pretty heady stuff to me.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I knew we were going to a church but wasn't real interested in which one. I knew nothing about God. About finding him or speaking to him. I never prayed back then, even when I was in trouble. I heard the occasional nod to the notion of God in my house, mostly from my mom. From time to time she'd mentioned "the Good Lord" when she spoke of some distant disaster or capricious act of fate. Otherwise, her references to God were polite and without weight. I'd been to church a few times with her—once to an Episcopal service and a couple of times to this highbrow Presbyterian Church downtown. Both of them bored me to tears. In fact I'd got into a fistfight with some rich kid who smarted off to me in Presbyterian Sunday school. She stopped taking me there after that.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">So I wasn't much on church, But if church was where the Bonitays wanted to go, I'd go there too. We ended up parking in a dirt lot outside this little wood frame shack called the Brownsville Assembly of God. This was 1965 or 6. Up until a year or so prior I'd been raised in Southern California—you know, with the Beach Boys and Gidget and all that Godless surf culture in its heyday—so this Pentecostal church on the wrong side of the tracks in the panhandle of Florida just couldn't have been any further removed from my understanding if it had been a ruby studded spaceship full of six eyed Martians.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">As I walked up the steps I thought to myself, "Well, here I am at another one of God's houses. Whoop dee doo." At those other churches I was told to sit still a lot, act polite and smile frequently. Stand up. Sing. Sit down. Stand up again. Pray. Like that. I figured this would be more of the same, so I was caught a little flatfooted by the palpable energy present as we entered the little room where the services were held. We took our seats just as the singing commenced, and the sound of it about knocked me sideways. What a wonder it was to hear these poor raggedy people lift their voices in unison, singing What A Friend We Have In Jesus, That Old Rugged Cross... songs like that. I'd never heard singing like that before; wailing, and plaintive and defiant like it was.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Johnny shoved me his hymnal. Apparently, he didn't need it. Apparently, any self-respecting Bonifay knew all the hymns by heart. Johnny sang every word to every song like his brain was about to split in two. I simultaneously admired his conviction and thought he looked... well, like some kind of demented cat in heat. I couldn't figure out why he was getting so worked up about singing. I didn't understand what it was like to be madly in love with Jesus.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Once the singing had run its course the Pastor welcomed everyone warmly, addressing the congregation informally and they said hello back, which I remember struck me as odd. Something was going on here. The whole proposition seemed off balance and volatile and relatively unchurchlike. People were far too involved. They spoke back to the Pastor, and he responded in kind. They asked for prayer for afflicted loved ones. They testified how Jesus had done this or that in their lives.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It was during this give and take that Johnny's mama rose unexpectedly, lifted her arms, closed her eyes and began making those weird singing noises. Like "Ashan-dalala coona-nanda-ledee". My hair stood on end. I wondered if she might be having a seizure or something. I waited for someone to tell her to hush, or call an ambulance, but nobody did. Instead, the congregation, they fell silent and listened intently as the syllables tumbled from her lips and echoed all around the room.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">There wasn't one bit of sense to what she was saying—the fragments of sound coming in no understandable order. That said, the tone and cadence of them was nothing short of hypnotic. After she'd had her say there was this stillness in the room, like a pistol had been fired in the air and it was somehow important to study the tell-tale smoke trail hanging there. Then on the other side of the room a man rose and spoke out in that same sing-songy way. Whatever message he was trying to convey, it sounded less comforting than when Johnny's mama had her say.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">When I got home from the Bonifay's house Sunday afternoon, I replayed the whole scene for my mom, how we’d gone to church and how Johnny's mama spoke as she did. She was puzzled by this report, frowning slightly at the notion of her progressive southern Californian son being taken to a hillbilly church.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">At school on Monday Johnny explained that his mama was "spirit filled" and that the language she was speaking was called "tongues". Tongues was way of speaking to God with secret words that only God understood. What was said had no earthly meaning unless the Lord delivered a Word of Knowledge to someone in the congregation, at which point they'd stand and interpret what the person speaking in tongues had said. Johnny said this happened from time to time.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I asked if he'd ever spoken in tongues. Johnny said no, he was waiting on something called "the baptism of the Holy Spirit", and that when he got that, that's when the tongues would come. It might come tomorrow, and it might never come. That's just how it was. It was a gift from God that came of its own volition. All this he said was reported as fact, with no apology or hemming and hawing, so as it went in my brain, it did so unfettered by critical thought.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Over the school year I accompanied the Bonifays a few more times to Brownsville, always thrilling when it came time for the congregation to loosen up and start speaking in tongues—during the prayer requests before the sermon, then later during the altar call at the end of the service.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Johnny never did get the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but one of his older brothers, Lang, did. He'd answered an altar call one Sunday in the spring and was kneeling up at the pulpit. From the pew where we sat, we could hear Lang speak his first words in tongues. The deacons had gathered around him, laying hands on his forehead and shoulders. They beckoned and teased and coaxed the Holy Spirit to draw near, to fall on this boy as if the Holy Spirit were some skittish wild animal, one that had to be lured within reach. Lang lifted his trembling arms over and over, begging Jesus to anoint him. Finally the sounds began, haltingly at first, then with greater and greater alacrity. By the end Lang began to cry, then sob hysterically, which at first struck me as unsettling, as he was quiet like his mama, hard-nosed and secretive and not one to make a fuss about himself. But later I realized that it was good that he’d been allowed to let all that crying out, as it must have been welling up inside of him his whole life.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Summer came, school let out and Johnny and I lost touch with each other, as kids do. We were assigned different teachers the next fall and so that put an end to my visits to that hillbilly church on the wrong side of the tracks. Six or more years passed, then in my mid-teens one Sunday morning I found myself over that way again. But this trip, it had nothing to do with church. I was there to buy some dope—sixteen hits of something called Purple Microdot, which was a popular form of LSD at the time. In theory I was gonna keep three or four hits for myself, then sell the rest to some kids at my school. The dealer who sold me the LSD, he was this jumpy white trash kid I'd met at Union Pool Hall. He was a little older than me and lived in a trailer over in Brownsville. As I was riding my ten-speed home I just happened to pass by that little church. I could hear them singing inside so I stopped and listened for a while.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">For a couple of years now I'd been dabbling with drugs and running with some marginal criminal types. I'd had two friends die of overdoses in the last few months. I'd already overdosed once myself—just pills I stole from the medicine cabinet, nothing officially illegal. I had my stomach pumped and that was that, but I recognized that I was a little too much like the two who’d died, and of late I'd begun to worry about my future as a human being. I never did have much in the way of self-control and tended to get stupid pretty quick when doing drugs. My problem was simple; once I got started, I didn't know how to stop. However, much dope I had, sooner or later I’d take it all, getting higher and higher until I’d pass out or flip out or something. That's what would probably happen with the Purple Microdot. I'd eat a hit, then another, then another until it was all gone and I'd end up talking to the dog or fighting the towel rack in the bathroom, like I had times before...</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">To pay for the drugs I'd started stealing, both from family and friends, and making stupid decisions that I knew were signs of harder times to come. I'd been wondering what I might do to save myself but couldn't think of anything, short of running away or lying about my age and joining the military. I was fifteen at the time.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">But there it was, that hillbilly church. Over the last few months I'd heard that a couple of my drug buddies had gone there and got saved. Everyone called them "Jesus Freaks" now because they'd kicked drugs and were getting high on God instead. I never saw them hanging around at Union Pool Hall anymore. It was confusing to me how hippie dope heads from middle class families would take refuge in such a conservative poor white church. I stood there for ten or more minutes just listening to the singing. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. What was I waiting for there? Was I looking for some vestige of my lost self? Some refuge from my rampaging coming of age weaknesses and frailties? After another few minutes I went inside.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It was still a shotgun shack that seated fifty or so. I sat in the back pew and surveyed the congregation of hardscrabble white southerners seated before me. The Bonifays weren't there, but I saw one ex-druggie friend of mine. He was sitting right up front, clutching a bible and nodding, calling out amens and singing along with the rest of the congregation. He didn't seem to notice that I'd come in.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Nothing much had changed. When the singing ended the room went still and one by one, they rose; a drab middle-aged woman with a beehive hairdo who called out sharp Arab sounding syllables, a young mother whose speaking sounded almost Scandinavian, an old man with tobacco stains around the corner of his mouth who made sort of jerky, whining noises. And each time someone would stand and start speaking in tongues I'd feel this terrible ache inside of me, this insoluble hunger for the abandon they seemed to achieve in these moments of surrender to God.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">The Pastor spoke heatedly about the wages of a sinful life that day, often looking my way as he made his point. At the end of the sermon, he tearfully asked if the Lord was speaking to any heart among us. I'd seen enough altar calls with the Bonifays to know the routine. The Pastor asks everyone to close their eyes, then pleads for those who might feel the Lord tugging on their sleeve to simply raise their hands so he can pray for them. It seems innocent enough. You raise your hand. "I see you," the Pastor will say. "And you and you. Keep your hands raised."</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">But once your hand's in the air, then the Pastor puts you the squeeze on you by saying that now that you've acknowledged that the Lord is calling you, you have to step forward and kneel at that old fashioned altar. It's a well-designed set up. I knew all this, but along with a few others who likewise were seated in the rear of the church, I raised my hand. I felt some invisible force pulling on me and didn't really care to fight it. The Pastor beckoned those of us who raised our hands to come forward and kneel before the Lord and pray to be saved, so I stepped out into the aisle and headed for the altar.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Once there the deacons laid hands on us and soon enough that old familiar din of tongues began to fill my ears. The Pastor approached me, laid his meaty paw on my forehead and passionately asked if I was willing to surrender my life to Jesus. I said yes. He then began to speak in tongues as he applied pressure to my forehead, as if attempting to drive some seminal power through my skull. He thanked Jesus for saving this hippie boy over and over and cited the scripture in Acts where the disciples were anointed and went forth to speak in strange tongues and prophesy. He asked the Lord to bless me with these selfsame gifts. At that point I noticed that one of the other converts next to me had begun haltingly speaking in tongues and realized I was expected to do the same.</p>
 
 <!-- Large Praying text -->
 
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">The Pastor began to pray over me more fervently. I started crying for no reason, like Lang did, and waited for the tongues to hit me. He told me to open my mouth and prepare for the outpouring, which I did. A few minutes of this fevered praying passed, as I waited for some otherly force to seize me, but none came. The sensation was something akin to that moment when you get sick in the belly and your churning stomach is trying to decide whether to reject the poison inside you or continue on digesting that unwholesome kernel. I opened my mouth wider, hoping, praying for that flood of secret syllables to come coursing out, but nothing came.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I became aware of the din of tongues around me once more, deacons and elders of the church, women in the pews—it seemed like everyone was speaking that way. I noticed that, of the other four converts, two of them now spoke convincingly, but the one to my left, his speech came out in sort of stilted, un-rhythmic manner. It didn't sound right. It didn't sound like real tongues. I couldn't tell you how I knew, I just did—he was faking it—you know, just making up nonsense syllables that he thought would pass for the real thing. It made me mad. It seemed like a terrible sin to fake something so sacred.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">There and then I vowed to myself that I'd never do that—you know, pretend to speak to God in tongues. So I waited, hoping the sounds would rise out of me of their own volition, but they never did. The altar call wound down, everyone began to disperse as the house lights came up. The Pastor told me that I was saved and that from now on I should live a Christian life. I told him I would. He assured me that the blessings of the Holy Spirit would come in good time, if only I stayed true to the Lord.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I went outside and fetched my bike from some azalea bushes where I'd stashed it. It was only then that I realized that I still had that LSD in my pocket. Now that I was saved, what would I do with it? I couldn't really sell it or eat it myself anymore, because I was saved. What if I just gave it to one of my drug buddies? No—that would probably be a sin too. I had to think about sin now that I was saved. In the end when I got home I flushed all sixteen hits of Purple Microdot down the toilet, which was my first real trial as a Christian, because that was about a hundred dollars worth of top-notch psychedelics.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">From then on I tried to walk a Godly path. I truly did. I quit doing drugs and hanging out with my dopehead friends at Union Pool Hall. I witnessed to unbelievers, read the bible, prayed many times daily and went to that church in Brownsville regularly. I answered more altar calls, hoping to receive the gift of tongues or the baptism of the Holy Spirit but nothing of that sort was ever bestowed on me. I wondered why and began to search the bible for answers. I found that passage where Luke rhetorically asked, "If a son asks his father for a fish will he be given a serpent?" The scripture seemed to imply that the Lord would not deny the prayers of those who sought him in earnest. Well, I'd sought in earnest. I'd asked for a fish. Asked over and over, but no good ever came of it.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It began to bother me. If this scripture was to be believed, then why didn't the Lord grant me this gift of tongues? I desired so deeply to communicate my deepest thoughts to Him without this weight that words forever bring to expression. What was it? Was I doing something wrong? Was there something ungodly inside of me? I sought wise counsel, as the bible instructs. The Pastor reassured me that the tongues would come. He told me that faith was like a muscle and that my faith was still weak. He said I needed to spend more time on my knees before the Lord, growing stronger and stronger in my relationship with Jesus, so I did. I prayed hard to lose myself in my love for Jesus.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Sometimes in prayer I would see sparks taking shape under my eyelid but they never formed anything that made any sense. Just pretty geometric shapes and forms. But nothing in relation to tongues changed. Months passed and I watched as others around me received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, sometimes kids no more than ten-twelve years old. But it never did come to me.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I began to listen more intently when tongues were being spoken at church, dissecting the sounds. Occasionally I'd hear someone speak in a manner that seemed contrived, but for the most part what was said sounded authentic, fluent and untainted by thought or premeditation. When no one was around sometimes I'd move my lips, miming the movements of those who spoke, trying to see if I could create the sounds independent of any Godly emotion, but nothing would come out. There were times kneeling there at the altar with the deacons gathered round and laying hands on me as they spoke in tongues that I felt so close to crossing that threshold, to surrendering to that army of mysterious utterances massing on the border of my paralyzed, deliberate mind, revealing the luminous feeling that lurks in the shadows behind waking thought. But no breakthrough ever occurred.</p>

But no breakthrough ever occurred.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I persevered, answering altar calls almost on a weekly basis. Was it just my imagination or did the Pastor start wincing slightly when he’d see me coming down the aisle, my face filled with dogged determination, approaching the altar, waiting for the tongues to descend upon me? Over and over deacons laid hands on me. They'd speak in tongues and command me to do the same. I'd hang my mouth open like the village idiot and silently pray and pray and pray but no divine syllables ever proceeded from my lips. This song and dance wore thin on everyone involved, me included. It was embarrassing, this case of spiritual dry heaves that I had. Truth be told I felt less and less welcome at the Brownsville Assembly of God. Not too long afterwards, maybe four months or so, I quit attending services there.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I still followed Jesus. Prayed for the un-saved. Avoided the pool hall and drugs. Rebuked any untoward sexual ideation I might have, even toward girls I'd kissed once or twice. No cussing. Be prepared for the Rapture. I was a Christian, I just didn't go to church. I thought I was doing pretty good with it, but some months later a friend took me aside and reminded me of that scripture in Hebrews where Paul instructs us not to forsake the gathering of the brethren. My friend told me I needed to get back into some kind of fellowship. I couldn't really argue with the Apostle Paul, so I joined this Wednesday night home bible study run by several ex-drug addicts who were now hardcore members of the church in Brownsville.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I went there for a couple of months. It was no secret that I couldn't speak in tongues. Everyone knew. They knew and it weighed on them how I was crippled that way. Then one night after the study had ended, the leaders of the bible study gathered around me and told me they had received a Word of Knowledge that I was going to receive the gift of tongues that night. I was so excited. After everyone else left we gathered in the back yard behind the house under the stars and seven or eight of them began laying hands on me and praying, commanding me in the name of Jesus to speak in tongues. Once again I opened my mouth and once again no sound proceeded from it.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">There was this one Christian Brother, Crazy Dave, he'd been something of a menace to society before he got saved. Throwing live hand grenades at adversaries, knocking down houses with stolen bulldozers, stuff like that. He went on to become a legendary missionary in the Philippines. He wore this bizarre suit that was covered with blinking Christmas tree lights. He'd wander the slums of Manila nightly in this truly surreal garment, which aside from the lights had the face of Jesus illuminated on the back, fearlessly winning souls to Christ. Anyway, in the middle of the praying Crazy Dave pressed his face close to mine and, hearing no tongues coming from my mouth, commanded, "Give it a syllable to get it started!"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">"What?" I said, cracking one eye open.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">"La-la-la!" Crazy Dave hissed. "Say it! Make tongues sounds! Prime the pump, brother! Prime the pump!"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">There's nothing more reassuring than bad advice from a born-again maniac. The notion that my soul was a pump in need of priming seemed poorly thought out to me. The face of that kid who’d faked speaking in tongues jumped into my mind to remind me that I was veering perilously close to sacrilegious territory. But it didn't matter; I was just so stone cold desperate to be shut of this mental obstruction at that point that I went ahead and opened my mouth and closed my mind and tried to do as I was told. Though a part of me was screaming no, no, no, I made my brain tell my mouth to say la-la-la, and you know what? A sound did come slipping out my lips a moment later. What sound was it? La-la-la? No. Was it the outpouring of mellifluous tongues, the ashandala, ecoondayay, melishonana sound? Not really... What escaped my lips, it sounded. well the closest thing I can think of is that sickly sound you make right before you throw up. That heaving, "rrrrugh" sound.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">There's nothing more reassuring than bad advice from a born-again maniac. The notion that my soul was a pump in need of priming seemed poorly thought out to me.

 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">I wanted so badly to believe him that I made another retching sound. And then did the dam break? No. If anything, it got more backed up. I felt so pent up inside that I couldn't take it anymore. I started making quicker, more frantic grunting noises for the next few minutes. I think I might have been hyperventilating. This got the others excited, so everyone began to urge me on. "Prime the pump!" They were chanting,"Prime the pump!"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">But these noises didn't sit well with Crazy Dave. This wasn't priming the pump. To Crazy Dave this sounded more like pig grunts, which was a serious development, because it signified a much darker dimension of spiritual warfare. He stopped the proceedings, shouting, "It might be a demon holding his tongue..."</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">That got everyone's attention. Crazy Dave reminded the others of the scripture in the book of Mark where Jesus drives that demon out of the possessed man and the demon jumps into a herd of pigs, who in turn hurl themselves off a cliff and drown in the sea. Crazy Dave's diagnosis was that if I was making pig noises then I must have a demon holding my tongue, so he took immediate action to remedy the situation. He never was faint of heart. He began to rebuke the demon holding my tongue.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Well, to say I was speechless would sort of be redundant, wouldn't it? But when the others chimed in, following Crazy Dave's lead, rebuking the Devil in me, I knew I'd had enough.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">For several years now I'd come before the Lord, earnestly asking for what was simply promised to me in scripture. Not only was I never granted that gift, something I was clearly promised, I was now being accused of being demon possessed. Was this due to some failing of mine as well? Some further weakness of my faith? Sure it was possible, but, you know what? Wasn't it just as possible that it wasn't? Wasn't it possible that all of this, my salvation, my long quest to speak to God in tongues, all of it was just some terribly misguided fools errand? I tried to push these heretical thoughts out of my mind. Whatever the case, after a few minutes of being fiercely rebuked, I closed my mouth and left the bible study, which, I'm sure, confirmed to Crazy Dave and the others the presence of a demon in me, a demon who had just handily defeated them.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">The upshot of this? Well, the writing was on the wall. I wasn't made for a Godly life, not at least in a hardcore Christian sense. I quit going to gatherings with Christians.A year or so later I left town, moved out west. I bounced around a few of those feel-good hippie churches in California and Hawaii, with young preachers who were easy going and cool, but once you've been to a hardcore Pentecostal church, it's hard to take those other places seriously. They always felt like, well like high school social dubs, rather than places to go to seek the spine tingling presence of the Lord. I went back and forth for a couple of years, trying a few more times to connect with hardcore Christians, to find some church that better fit the complications of my bottled up psyche, but things made less and less sense each time. Then came a Sunday at one of those churches where I had a sort of nervous breakdown. In the middle of the service I felt and followed the uncontrollable urge to run out the door and drive away, and that was it. From there on I cut my ties with the church and Jesus and began to attempt to lead a secular life. I was twenty-four years old by then.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It sounds easy enough doesn't it? Just go and lead a normal life. But the Jesus imprint was on me. Almost ten years of it. It was only after I tried to pull away that I realized the full extent of how thoroughly I’d been programmed... I spent the next ten or so years wandering and drifting, trying to shake free of the clutches of whatever it was that had me, God, or the Devil or some ridiculous contrivance of my own mind.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Back home I was known as a backslider, someone who essentially had betrayed Jesus. This hurt. I'd come home for visits and would see the sad looks on my former friends faces as they told me of their lives, spoke of their church, their walk with the Lord. They knew I was bound for hell and wanted to protect me from myself, and while I appreciated their concern for my eternal soul I let it be known that I wanted no part of Jesus or church, so they held their tongues, no pun intended.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">When I hit thirty I finally went to college. Over the next six years I studied a fair amount of religion and philosophy, trying to make sense of what I'd experienced there in that poor little church in the panhandle of Florida. But at the end of the day reading is just reading and studying is just studying isn't it? What words said in a book could ever compare to the visceral experience of standing in a tumbledown church on Sunday morning surrounded by everyday people who are speaking to God in unknown languages?</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">You know how it is when you realize you've made terrible mistakes and you try to set things straight? And all you do is just mess everything, up worse? That's how it was with me. The unravelling of my hardcore Christian mind made quite a mess. I behaved poorly along the way, doing things that hurt others, things that revealed the sundry weakness of my character, weaknesses that had been veiled by the Christian constructs that I used to prop myself up with all those years.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Thankfully I never once considered that my failings might be the result of some demon within—although from time to time the idea of throwing myself off a clift and drowning in the sea sounded pretty attractive. No, I wasn't demon possessed, I was just messed up. I was lost in a way that couldn't be helped by some artificial notion of God. Things were wrong inside of me and I realized that the only way I could ever live in my own skin was if I learned how to make peace with that wrongness.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It took a lot of time. A lot of trial and error. Along the way there were times when I wondered if I'd done the right thing, denouncing my faith in Jesus. The church provides a shape and form that is sometimes helpful to weak, directionless people like I was. Would I ever be strong enough to stand on my own?</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">From time to time the notion of tongues would return to me. I'd see an instance of it represented in film or pass a church on Sunday morning and hear that old familiar sound, but the ache in my heart for that surrender to some higher power, to join in and become lost in the presence of God lessened in degrees. One day in my early forties I noticed it had just up and disappeared altogether. What a relief. Coincidentally this was around the time my first child was born. I'm fifty-two now. Three years back my second daughter was born. She and her older sister, my wife, they're the lynchpins of my existence. In the early morning, after my wife has left for work and the breakfast dishes are done, this sweet little child comes and hugs my neck. She whispers in my ear two words; "Monkey Land." Now, to be clear, Monkey Land, it's not a place or a TV show, it's a game she and I invented on our own. This game is played on her mom and dad's king-sized bed, so I carry her in there and set her down dead center in the middle.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">First my little girl makes what she calls a "bird nest" from the pile of blankets... then she hides under the covers there. When she seems settled I ask her if she's ready. When she says yes, I ask if she's really ready. Usually this'll set off a little flurry of adjustments, then she'll give me the green light. At that point I'll go fetch a large monkey puppet that I found at a flea market some years back. Now this monkey, he's not all peaches and cream. He's raggedy and ornery, and terribly stubborn. His primary goal is to raid the nest and take the little bird with him to Monkey Land. Her goal is to not go there. So the monkey comes in the room and loudly, vociferously hunts for her. "Little bird, where are you hiding?" the monkey puppet shouts in his rough, gravelly voice... "Little Bird, I know you're hiding here somewhere! I've come to take you to Monkey Land!"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Gales of laughter proceed from under the covers. "No!" She'll squeal gleefully, "I don't want to go to Monkey Land!!"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">So he searches for her, "Is this a bird nest I see? Hmm, let me examine it more closely!" More sweet squealing laughter. When he finally finds her hiding there he attacks her and tries to pull her out of her bird nest. But she's too strong! She and the monkey wrestle and howl and growl at each other. He menaces and cajoles and teases, "Come with me to Monkey Land!" he pleads, "Come with me to Monkey Monkey Monkey Land"</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Before too long she's had enough. She sits up in her bird nest and sternly informs the monkey that she's not going to Monkey Land and that if he doesn't behave, he's gonna get put in time out! The monkey moans and gripes, but ultimately he doesn't want to go to time out, so he begins to apologize. It's truly pathetic. She tells him he has one more chance. From then on, the monkey is a picture of contrition. He begs for her love and whimpers and cries. She tells him to calm down and pats his head understandingly. When he manages to get control of himself, she hugs his neck and. tells him she loves him and asks him to tell her a story. They lay their heads down on the feather pillow that her mama sleeps on. She closes her eyes and that's when the monkey tells her a story—a story that's conveyed not in English, but in his special monkey language, which sounds something like this:</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">Oooloo-masha-goozoo-ooolee-amma-neely-magga-alla-wooozoo-oonu-goolee.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">She answers back in a similar language. We carry on long, apparently complicated conversations, me as the monkey voice and her as herself. Watching my daughter hugging the puppet monkey's neck and my hand within, gently conversing with her cantankerous friend in monkey talk is a blessing I cannot describe. I simply have no. words for it.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">It was during one of these exchanges a few weeks back, after an extended sing-songy discussion that it suddenly hit me; the sounds I was making sounded exactly like tongues, like what I'd so desperately prayed for all those years ago. I listened as the nonsensical syllables effortlessly flowed from my lips. There was a river of them coursing out from somewhere deep inside my heart. I was speaking in tongues, not to Jesus, but to my beautiful daughter. </p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">What released the magic? What primed the pump and made the dam break? I guess it was love. Because I truly deeply madly love my little daughter. This makes me wonder, did I not love Jesus? It's hard to say. Sometimes the distinction between love and devotion is so difficult to demark, much less define and decipher. I was devoted to Jesus, profoundly so, but that devotion was never enough to set free what was imprisoned inside of me. It took a child. It took my beautiful little girl, and of course, a raggedy monkey puppet.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break">As I watched her there, hugging the monkey's neck and speaking to him in her sing-songy voice, a scripture from the book of Isaiah came to mind. It says, "And a little child shall lead them." At last, a scripture that proved itself true.</p>
 <p class="no-indent paragraph-break-double">I guess I should mention that Johnny Bonifay eventually became a Pastor himself. He now lays hands on the foreheads of others seeking to disappear in the shadow of something larger than themselves. I wish him luck. You have to find your route to love, now don't you? Some choose Jesus. I go to Monkey Land. How do you put yourself in proximity to the divine?</p>
